## Description

The project challenge was to design and implement an automated stacker using a Dobot MagicianÂ© robotic arm. The project involved designing and creating Arduino code to deploy on to an Arduino Uno to control the robot arm. The specification for the project was:

- To be able to segregate blocks by type into 3 different areas.
- To be able to unload a block from a chosen bay.
- To have enough capacity to manage 10 blocks in total.

Development has now **FINISHED** for this project as the group no longer has access to the Dobot Magician. The FutureChanges branch contains some better written code and ideas than main branch due to time constraints during the project however it has not been tested and should be used with caution.
